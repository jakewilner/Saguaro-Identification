# Saguaro Identification

## About:
This project is a YOLOv5 object recognition model, designed to categorize the buds, flowers and fruit of Saguaro cacti. The notebook in this folder is designed to be run as a Colab notebook, however our API key has been removed. The various versions of this project run on a configuration of YOLOv5 architecture.

## Deployed Model:
This model's active deployment can be viewed here:

Currently, "Full Augmented Data YOLOv5 std" (version 4) is the most effective and consistent model.
